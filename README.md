# bfx-report-ui

The frontend of bfx-report at https://report.bitfinex.com

Should work with [bfx-report](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report)


The hosted version of report (https://report.bitfinex.com) will not allow access via API keys (for security reasons), https://report.bitfinex.com will be only accessible starting from https://www.bitfinex.com/report that will redirect the user to https://report.bitfinex.com/?auth=UUID

User can use either the UUID or the API key to access his data.
